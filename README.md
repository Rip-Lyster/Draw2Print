# Draw2Print

Before starting with Draw2Print, it is highly suggested that the following
is read:

Draw2Print is a gcode generator for 3d printing. It is create entirely in Python
and implements graphics using Python's standard graphics package Tkinter. Install
Python and Tkinter by going to python.org and selecting the download link. Select
the operating system that the computer that will run Draw2Print has installed and 
install the Python package. From here, Draw2Print can be run from the terminal
window or in an IDE. To run in the terminal, research how to run a file in the
terminal on the computers operating system and follow those. To run in an IDE,
find the preffered IDE online and follow the instructions to download and run
programs through it. Draw2Print contains 2 main files and these should always be
in the same folder. When running Draw2Print, only the DrawToPrintGUI.py file
should be run. This is the file that contains all of the graphics and is the only
file that will actually run the full program.
