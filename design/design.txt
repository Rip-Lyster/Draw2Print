Draw2Print is a gcode generator implemented in python using tkinter. My program
allows the user to input a profile of the shape that they want to create into the drawing
window and then slice the object to create the actual gcode that can then be used to print
the object. This solves the problem that is currently faced with 3d printing of the user
having to use 2 different programs to get the gcode to print their object. This program also
simplifies the process of modelling an object for 3d printing by providing the user with
a 2d drawing canvas and only asking for the drawing and the height of the profile. The UI is
built around simplicity. I put help text on every screen and also offer an in depth help text
on a seperate screen. There are also settings for only what the algorithm needs to calculate
the gcode. This means that the user doesn't have to worry about any unneccessary settings.
